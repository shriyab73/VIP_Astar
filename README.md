This repository contains a reproduction of optimized 16-directional A* approach outlined in https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11888910/. The four main A* methods/approaches that were implemented can be found in the .py files, while visualization and metrics are consolidated in the Jupyter notebook. These files can be run using any Python interpreter containing the necessary libraries.
